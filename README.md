Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into the notebook using pandas and prepared for analysis
Summary Statistics: We compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive measures to get an overview of the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Identifying missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the data.
Univariate Analysis:We visualize the distribution of individual features (e.g., using histograms or box plots) to understand their spread, central tendency, and potential issues like skewness.
Multivariate Analysis:We dive deeper into more complex relationships, exploring interactions between multiple variables. Techniques like pair plots and heatmaps are used here.

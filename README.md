Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into the notebook using pandas and prepared for analysis
Summary Statistics: We compute basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive measures to get an overview of the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Identifying missing values, duplicates, null value then count the no.value_counts
about text no.of character,no.of words & no.sentence .
finally display the polt about count.

Text Preprocessing
transforming raw data into format that is easier to understand and process by algorithms. It involves:
Lowercasing- convert all text to lowercase e.g. "Hello"->"hello"
Tokenization- split the text into smaller units such as words. e.g. "I am a programmer"->["I","am","a","programmer"]
Removing Punctuation- Eliminate special characters and punctuation e.g. "hello!"->"hello"
Removing stop words- Eliminate common words like "and","the","in",etc that don't add much meaning
Stemming- reduce words to their root form e.g. "running"->"run" OR Lemmatization- converts word to their base form with meaning.
